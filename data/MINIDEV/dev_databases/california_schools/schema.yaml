domain notes:
  - Excellence Rate can be calculated as NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr from the satscores table

  - Enrollment (K-12) from the frpm table refers to students in grades 1 through 12 

  - eligible free rate = Free Meal Count / Enrollment from the frpm table
  
  - eligible FRPM rate = FRPM / Enrollment from the frpm table

  - GSoffered may differ from GSserved in the schools table. GSoffered represents the grades the school is designed to serve, while GSserved represents actual student enrollment grades reported in CALPADS. Special programs at independent study, alternative education, and special education schools often exceed typical grade spans

  - Virtual instruction separates students and teachers by time/location with interaction via computers and telecommunications. Schools are classified as Exclusively Virtual (F), Primarily Virtual (V), Primarily Classroom (C), Not Virtual (N), or Partial Virtual (P - retired value)

  - In the US: higher longitude values (closer to 0) = further east
  
  - Lower absolute latitude values = closer to equator
