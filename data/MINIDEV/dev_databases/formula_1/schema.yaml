domain notes:
  - The finishing time in the results table; Only the winner's time shows in the format "minutes:seconds.millisecond", while other drivers' times show as "+seconds.millisecond" representing the time gap to the winner

  - Qualifying rounds (Q1, Q2, Q3) progressively eliminate slower drivers; Q1 eliminates the bottom 5 drivers, Q2 eliminates the next 5 drivers, and Q3 determines the final top 10 grid positions

  - Points are awarded in each race based on finishing position, with the winner typically receiving the most points

  - Fastest lap times and speeds are tracked separately from race finishing times and can earn bonus points

  - Pit stop duration is a critical performance metric, with faster pit stops providing competitive advantages

  - Driver and constructor standings accumulate points across races throughout a season to determine championship winners
